# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

## Issue Summary:

### Duration:
     March 9, 2024, 14:00 - 18:30 (UTC)

## Impact: 
    Unavailability of our primary web service, affecting 30% of users with slow response times for the remaining 70%.

## Root Cause: 
    Database connection pool exhaustion leading to degraded system performance.
    
## Timeline:

14:00: Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating increased response times.
14:10: Investigation initiated by the DevOps team.
14:30: Initial assumption of a potential DDoS attack; network configurations and firewalls inspected.
15:00: No evidence of a DDoS attack found; focus shifted to application layer and database.
15:30: Misleading investigation into application code; unnecessary code reviews and patches applied.
16:00: Issue escalated to the Database and Backend Development teams.
16:30: Database connection pool exhaustion identified as the root cause.
17:00: Immediate mitigation steps taken to alleviate database pressure; scaling up resources.
18:00: Performance monitoring tools indicated a gradual improvement.
18:30: Service fully restored; operations back to normal.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: Database connection pool exhaustion due to a sudden surge in concurrent user requests.
Resolution: Adjusted database connection pool settings, increased capacity, and optimized query performance. Implemented load balancing to distribute requests evenly.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

## Improvements/Fixes:

Enhanced Monitoring: Implement more granular monitoring for database connection pools and query performance.
Automated Scaling: Develop automated scaling mechanisms to dynamically adjust resources based on traffic spikes.
Incident Response Plan: Refine the incident response plan to streamline investigations and minimize time to resolution.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Database Tuning: Regularly review and optimize database queries to prevent future performance bottlenecks.
Scalability Testing: Conduct thorough scalability testing to identify potential stress points before they impact users.
Documentation Update: Enhance documentation for troubleshooting common performance issues and their resolutions.
Training: Provide training sessions for teams on recognizing and responding to different types of incidents promptly.
This incident provided valuable insights into the critical importance of a well-orchestrated incident response plan and the need for comprehensive monitoring at all levels of the web stack. Going forward, we are committed to implementing these corrective and preventative measures to ensure a more resilient and scalable system, minimizing the impact of potential future incidents on our users.

As part of our continuous improvement process, we encourage feedback from all teams involved in the incident response to further refine our procedures and fortify our infrastructure against unforeseen challenges.
